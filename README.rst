Description
===========

These databases integrate information from various projects at the 
Library and Information Center at Dharma Drum Buddhist College. 
By providing information on Chinese calendar dates, 
as well as an onomasticon of person and place names from 
Buddhist sources they help with disambiguation 
and geo-spatial referencing of names and dates.
